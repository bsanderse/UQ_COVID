# UQ_COVID
Uncertainty quantification (UQ) on COVID ODE model

This Matlab code provides the possibility to study the effect of parametric uncertainty in a simple SEIR-model that are typically used to study the spread of a virus outbreak like COVID-19.
The SEIR model is taken from the website of Peter Forsyth (https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~paforsyt/SEIR.html).
The UQ framework is based on UQLab (https://www.uqlab.com/).
